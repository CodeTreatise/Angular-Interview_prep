# 🔧 Framework Context - Section 02
## Strategic Framework Knowledge for Angular Interviews

*Priority Level: HIGH - Strategic understanding tested in 60%+ of Angular interviews*  
*Content Weight: Framework decision-making and comparison skills*  
*Audience: All experience levels with emphasis on strategic thinking*

---

## 📋 **SECTION OVERVIEW**

This section focuses on **framework comparison and strategic decision-making** - critical skills that separate good Angular developers from great ones. Modern interviews increasingly test your ability to make informed technology choices and articulate the reasoning behind framework selection.

### **🎯 Why Framework Context Matters**

**Business Impact:**
- Framework decisions affect entire project timelines and budgets
- Wrong framework choice can cost companies 6-12 months of development time
- Strategic framework knowledge demonstrates architectural thinking
- Framework comparison skills are essential for technical leadership roles

**Interview Reality:**
- 85% of interviews include "Why Angular vs React?" questions
- Senior roles require deep framework trade-off understanding
- Companies want developers who can justify technology decisions
- Framework knowledge correlates with higher salary offers
