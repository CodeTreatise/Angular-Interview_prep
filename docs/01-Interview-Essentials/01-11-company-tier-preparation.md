## ❓ **TIER-SPECIFIC INTERVIEW Q&A**

### **🎯 Tier 1 Sample: "Design a real-time collaborative editing system like Google Docs"**

**Perfect Tier 1 Answer:**
```typescript
// SYSTEM DESIGN APPROACH (Show architectural thinking):

"I'll design this system considering three main aspects: real-time synchronization, 
 conflict resolution, and scalable frontend architecture.

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                Frontend Layer                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Angular Components (Editor, Cursor, Collaboration)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ WebSocket Connection Manager (RxJS observables)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Operational Transform Engine (Conflict Resolution)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Local State Management (NgRx + Persistence)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

KEY FRONTEND COMPONENTS:

1. REAL-TIME SYNCHRONIZATION:
- WebSocket connections with automatic reconnection
- RxJS observables for real-time data streams
- Efficient diff algorithms for minimal data transfer
- Optimistic updates with rollback capability

2. CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
- Operational Transform (OT) implementation
- Vector clocks for causality ordering
- Last-writer-wins with user priority
- Automatic conflict resolution UI

3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
- Virtual scrolling for large documents
- OnPush change detection strategy
- Debounced operations batching
- CDN-cached static assets"

// TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
@Injectable()
export class CollaborativeEditorService {
  private ws: WebSocket;
  private operations$ = new Subject<Operation>();
  private documentState$ = new BehaviorSubject<DocumentState>({});
  
  constructor(private store: Store) {
    this.setupWebSocketConnection();
    this.setupOperationalTransform();
  }
  
  private setupOperationalTransform(): void {
    this.operations$.pipe(
      // Buffer operations for efficiency
      bufferTime(50),
      filter(ops => ops.length > 0),
      // Apply operational transform
      map(ops => this.transformOperations(ops)),
      // Update document state
      tap(transformedOps => this.applyOperations(transformedOps))
    ).subscribe();
  }
}

// SCALING CONSIDERATIONS:
- Micro-frontend architecture for large teams
- Service worker for offline editing capability
- Redis for operational transform state persistence
- Load balancing with WebSocket sticky sessions
```

### **🎯 Tier 2 Sample: "How do you implement role-based access control in Angular?"**

**Perfect Tier 2 Answer:**
```typescript
// PRACTICAL ENTERPRISE SOLUTION (Show real-world experience):

"In my last project, we implemented RBAC using a combination of route guards, 
 directive-based permissions, and service-layer access control.

OUR APPROACH:

1. USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS SERVICE:
@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  private user$ = new BehaviorSubject<User | null>(null);
  
  hasPermission(permission: string): boolean {
    const user = this.user$.value;
    return user?.roles.some(role => 
      role.permissions.includes(permission)
    ) || false;
  }
  
  hasRole(roleName: string): boolean {
    const user = this.user$.value;
    return user?.roles.some(role => role.name === roleName) || false;
  }
}

2. ROUTE-LEVEL PROTECTION:
@Injectable()
export class RoleGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private auth: AuthService, private router: Router) {}
  
  canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): boolean {
    const requiredRoles = route.data['roles'] as string[];
    
    if (requiredRoles?.some(role => this.auth.hasRole(role))) {
      return true;
    }
    
    this.router.navigate(['/unauthorized']);
    return false;
  }
}

3. COMPONENT-LEVEL PERMISSIONS:
@Directive({
  selector: '[hasPermission]'
})
export class HasPermissionDirective implements OnInit {
  @Input() hasPermission: string;
  
  constructor(
    private auth: AuthService,
    private templateRef: TemplateRef<any>,
    private viewContainer: ViewContainerRef
  ) {}
  
  ngOnInit(): void {
    if (this.auth.hasPermission(this.hasPermission)) {
      this.viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this.templateRef);
    } else {
      this.viewContainer.clear();
    }
  }
}

USAGE IN TEMPLATES:
<button *hasPermission="'USER_DELETE'" (click)="deleteUser()">
  Delete User
</button>

CHALLENGES WE FACED:
- Permission changes during session (solved with reactive updates)
- Complex nested permissions (created permission hierarchy)
- Performance with many permission checks (implemented caching)
- Testing role-based features (created testing utilities)"

// Show understanding of enterprise patterns, real challenges, team solutions
```

### **🎯 Tier 3 Sample: "Build a search component with filtering"**

**Perfect Tier 3 Answer:**

      { id: 2, name: 'React Guide', description: 'React fundamentals', category: 'Education' },

  onFilterChange(): void {

  private filterItems(): void {
    let filtered = [...this.items];
    
    // Filter by search term
    if (this.searchTerm.trim()) {
      const term = this.searchTerm.toLowerCase();
      filtered = filtered.filter(item =>
        item.name.toLowerCase().includes(term) ||
        item.description.toLowerCase().includes(term)
      );
    }
    
    // Filter by category
    if (this.selectedCategory) {
      filtered = filtered.filter(item => 
        item.category === this.selectedCategory
      );
    }
    
    this.filteredItems = filtered;
  }
}

interface Item {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
}

WHAT I'D ADD NEXT:
- Debouncing for search input (better performance)
- More filter options (date, price range, etc.)
- Sorting capabilities
- Pagination for large datasets
- Loading states and error handling

This shows I can build working features quickly and think about improvements."
